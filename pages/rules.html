        <p><em>Synced Regulations, read the terms of service at <a href="http://www.syncedonline.com/terms.html">http://www.syncedonline.com/terms.html</a></em></p>
        <p><strong>Rule 1: Don't harass other users.</strong>
            <br />There is a block feature for this and we recommend you to use it to block people from harassing you.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 2: Don't make another account to harass users.</strong>
            <br />This is pretty self explanatory. But if you were blocked by someone and then you decide to make a new account to continue harassing the user. You will be instantly temporary banned.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 3: Don't broadcast anything hurtful to others.</strong>
            <br />Not everyone want's to see you say something vulgar or really mean toward someone else. It's not welcome and we will remove your broadcasting rights if you use it to publically say some really hurtful things to others. If you feel you lost your broadcasting rights for the wrong reason. Do talk to a staff member about it.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 4: Don't upload any real life pictures of other people without their permission.</strong>
            <br />Some people really dislike their selfies being posted without permission along with the fact they hate it more so when people uses it to troll them publically. People have the right to request such pictures to be removed if/when needed.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 5: Don't be excessively offensive nor throw out threats to someone you dislike.</strong>
            <br />The blocking feature can only go so far, if you start excessively harrassing another user because you really dislike that person for some reason and they haven't blocked you. You should simply block them yourself then. People have the right to report such actions and we will review it and take action if needed.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 6: Don't spam another users profile.</strong>
            <br />There is a block option to stop users from spamming a profile, but even if there is we still don't welcome it non the less. If someone spams your profile with a bunch of nonsense or hurtful writing. Report it our way and we'll look into it.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 7: Don't post porn/sexual/violent content to anyone on the website.</strong>
            <br />This is also pretty self explanatory.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 8: Don't upload content that isn't yours, already in the shopped or already on the website in general.</strong>
            <br />We have a treasury that's designed to fix this issue over time, and granted it's a slow process but if you have an avatar you would like to wear or an object you don't own but have the files to give out. We can upload it to the Treasury so people can use it freely as they wish so everyone can enjoy content they use back from Whirled.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 9: Don't report for no reason at all.</strong>
            <br />The staff team try our best to keep this website safe and secure for everyone and we don't take kindly to joke reports or anything along those line</p>
