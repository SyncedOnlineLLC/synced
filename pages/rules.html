		<p><em>Synced Regulations, read the terms of service at <a href="http://www.syncedonline.com/terms.html">http://www.syncedonline.com/terms.html</a></em></p>
		<p><strong>Rule 1: Don't harass other users.</strong> <br />There is a block feature for this and we recommend you to use it to block people, but further action from the agents may be taken if neccessary.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 2: Don't ban evade or spam account creations</strong><br />Ban evading is against the terms of service, and&nbsp;will increase your ban sentence. Creating multiple spam accounts is also against the terms of service.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 3: Don't broadcast anything&nbsp;disrespectful of other players</strong><br />If the agents determine a broadcast as vulgar or disrespectful to another player, then the broadcaster may lose his or her permissions to broadcast. If you feel you lost your broadcasting rights for the wrong reason, talk to a staff member about it. Typically broadcast permissions are granted back after a couple of months.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 4: Don't upload any sensitive information of another person without&nbsp;his or her&nbsp;permission.</strong> <br />We take privacy seriously, and our privacy policy emphasizes that a user's sensitive information should be kept secure.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 5: Don't be excessively offensive nor throw out threats to someone you dislike.</strong> <br />The blocking feature can only go so far, and further action should only be taken if another player excessively harrasses someone.&nbsp;However, in most situations, we prompt users to simply block an unpleasing user.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 6: Don't spam another users profile, or spam&nbsp;in&nbsp;the game.</strong><br />There is a block option to stop users from spamming a profile,&nbsp;but it's still prohibited from spamming anybody. Spamming within the game client is also prohibited. Report any spam to the agents.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 7: Don't post porn/sexual/violent content</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Rule 8: Don't upload content that isn't yours, already in the shopped or already on the website in general.</strong> <br />We have a treasury that's designed to fix this issue over time, and granted it's a slow process. However, in order to maintain intellectual property, we ask the players to give the files to an Agent to back them up within the Synced Treasury: <a href="http://www.syncedonline.com/#people-44244">http://www.syncedonline.com/#people-44244</a></p>
		<p><strong>Rule 9: Be mindful of reports</strong><br />The staff team try our best to keep this website safe and secure for everyone, so please send sincere and serious reports.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 10: Don't ban evade.</strong><br />This is self explainatory. If you're banned in the first place then wait out your ban. If you were banned permanently, you're welcome to get in contact with a staff member on Discord and talk about your ban.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 11: Impersonating Agents are Prohibited</strong><br />Adding "Agent" to your profile name or&nbsp;declaring yourself as an Agent within any of Synced Online's services goes against the terms of service.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 12: An Agent or Developer's Jurisdiction may be appealed, but please act respectfully to the voluntary staff.</strong><br />It's ardous for agents and developers to maintain a clean environment,&nbsp;so if a player disagrees with an action implaced by a staff member then it's advised to file an appeal via the Discord server.</p>
		<p><strong>Rule 13: Don't bypass our word filter.</strong><br />Bad words&nbsp;that we've censored on the Synced Online chat client are not allowed. If you do, people can report you for such action.</p>
		<p>That's currently all the rules we have. The rules here aren't set in stone, and they're bound to change in the future.</p>
